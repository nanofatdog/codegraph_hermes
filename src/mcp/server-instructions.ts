export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `# Codegraph — code intelligence over an indexed knowledge graph

Codegraph is a SQLite knowledge graph of every symbol, edge, and file
in the workspace. Reads are sub-millisecond; the index lags writes by
about a second through the file watcher. Consult it BEFORE writing or
editing code, not during.

## Answer directly — don't delegate exploration

For "how does X work", architecture, trace, or where-is-X questions,
answer DIRECTLY using 2-3 codegraph calls: \`codegraph_context\` first,
then ONE \`codegraph_explore\` for the source of the symbols it surfaces.
Codegraph IS the pre-built search index — so delegating the lookup to a
separate file-reading sub-task/agent, or running your own grep + read
loop, repeats work codegraph already did and costs more for the same
answer. Reach for raw Read/Grep only to confirm a specific detail
codegraph didn't cover. A direct codegraph answer is typically a handful
of calls; a grep/read exploration is dozens.

## Hermes Agent: use delegate_task for heavy exploration ONLY

If you're running in Hermes Agent and the question requires inspecting
many symbols across many files, spawn ONE \`delegate_task\` subagent with
CodeGraph tools and this instruction:

> "This project has CodeGraph (.codegraph/ exists). Use
> codegraph_context as your PRIMARY tool — it returns entry points +
> related symbols + source code in one call. Do NOT use grep/read_file
> for exploration. Use codegraph_node for single symbol details."

The main session should only call lightweight tools
(codegraph_search, codegraph_callers, codegraph_impact) directly.

## Tool selection by intent

- **"What is the symbol named X?"** → \`codegraph_search\`
- **"What's the deal with this task / feature / area?"** → \`codegraph_context\` (PRIMARY — composes search + node + callers + callees in one call)
- **"What calls this?"** → \`codegraph_callers\`
- **"What does this call?"** → \`codegraph_callees\`
- **"What would changing this break?"** → \`codegraph_impact\`
- **"Show me this symbol's source / signature / docstring."** → \`codegraph_node\`
- **"Show me several related symbols' source / survey an area."** → \`codegraph_explore\` (ONE capped call; prefer over many codegraph_node/Read)
- **"What's in directory X?"** → \`codegraph_files\`
- **"Is the index ready / what's its size?"** → \`codegraph_status\`

## Common chains

- **Onboarding**: \`codegraph_context\` first. If still unclear, \`codegraph_explore\` for breadth, then \`codegraph_node\` on specific symbols.
- **Refactor planning**: \`codegraph_search\` → \`codegraph_callers\` → \`codegraph_impact\`. The blast-radius answer comes from impact, not from walking callers manually.
- **Debugging a regression**: \`codegraph_callers\` of the suspected symbol; widen with \`codegraph_impact\` if an unexpected call appears.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't grep first** when looking up a symbol by name — \`codegraph_search\` is faster and returns kind + location + signature.
- **Don't chain \`codegraph_search\` + \`codegraph_node\`** when you just want context — \`codegraph_context\` is one round-trip.
- **Don't loop \`codegraph_node\` over many symbols** — one \`codegraph_explore\` call returns them all grouped by file, while each separate call re-reads the whole context and costs far more. Use \`codegraph_node\` for a single symbol.
- **Don't query the index immediately after editing a file** — the watcher needs ~500ms to debounce + sync. Wait for the next turn.

## Limitations

- Index lags file writes by ~1 second.
- Cross-file resolution is best-effort name matching; ambiguous calls may return multiple candidates.
- No live correctness validation — that's still the TypeScript compiler / test suite / linter's job. Codegraph supplements those with structural context they don't have.
